# Algorithms and data structures
This repository contains algorithms and data structures implemented in C++.

## Goals:
* Provide _simple_, _efficient_ and _correct_ implementations.
* Code should be easy to use.
* Using modern C++ features.

## Structure:
* One directory per algorithm.
* Header file contains implementation.
* Source file contains usage examples.
